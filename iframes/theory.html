        <h2>Theory of Experiment</h2>
        <p>
            An Electron probe microanalysis is an electron beam instrument, most often used for the in situ chemical examination of solid materials. The electron optics of EPMA enable the examination of materials with far better resolution than those obtainable with visible-light lenses with a spot size of a few microns.
        </p>
        <p>
            These characteristics of EPMA allow for the employment of a variety of detectors, including wavelength dispersive spectrometers, secondary electron detectors, backscattered electron detectors, and other detector types. The schematic of EPMA is shown in Figure 1.
        </p>

        <p>
            Electrons that emerge from the electron source (LaB6, Field emission gun, etc.) are accelerated and rectified via a series of electromagnetic lenses, focused onto the sample. The interaction of the electron beam with the sample creates various effects such as secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, cathodoluminescence, continuum X-ray radiation, characteristic X-ray radiation, and Auger electrons.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main advantage of EPMA over conventional SEM is that it is equipped with crystal spectrometers, providing fine compositional analysis compared to EDS. Each element has its characteristic inner electron structure, which behaves as fingerprints of that element. The X-rays emitted from the sample are counted either by an EDS or WDS detector.
        </p>
        <p>
            In WDS, the crystal of known <em>d</em> spacing is used to diffract specific X-rays with characteristic wavelengths (λ), and the X-rays are counted by a detector. The sample, diffracting crystal, and detector are placed on a goniometer, as shown in Figure 2.

        <p>
            Depending on the element concentration to be analyzed, different types of diffracting crystals are used:
            <ul>
                <li>Small lattice spacing: Lithium fluoride (LiF(200)), element range: Ca to Ge.</li>
                <li>Medium lattice spacing: Pentaerythritol (PET(002)), element range: Si to Ti.</li>
                <li>Large lattice spacing: Thallium acid phthalate (TAP(100)), element range: O to Al.</li>
                <li>LSM80E with 2d spacing 7.8nm, element range: B to O.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The X-rays diffracted are collected by a CCD detector, which generates a spectrum from the diffracted X-rays. This spectrum is then compared with the reference spectra for chemical composition estimation. The counts from the sample must be corrected for matrix effects such as penetration factor, absorption, and secondary fluorescence, to yield accurate quantitative chemical compositions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the chemical data

                The main advantage of EPMA over conventional SEM is that it is equipped with crystal spectrometers, which provide fine compositional analysis compared to EDS. Each element has its characteristic inner electron structure, which behaves as fingerprints of that element. The X-rays produced are from the inner electron structure, so there is minimal effect from the bonding of elements.

                The X-rays emitted from the sample are counted either by an EDS or WDS detector. In WDS, the crystal of known d-spacing is used to diffract specific X-rays with characteristic wavelengths ("λ"), and the X-rays are counted by a detector.

                Depending on the element concentration to be analyzed, different types of diffracting crystals are used. Typical analyzing crystals that are used in a spectrometer include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Small lattice spacing: lithium fluoride (LiF(200)), spacing: 0.4 nm, element range from Ca to Ge.</li>
                    <li>Medium lattice spacing: pentaerythritol (PET(002)), spacing: 0.87 nm, element range from Si to Ti.</li>
                    <li>Large lattice spacing: thallium acid phthalate (TAP(100)), spacing: 2.6 nm, element range from O to Al.</li>
                    <li>LSM80E with 2d spacing of 7.8 nm, covering the element range from B to O.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The X-rays diffracted are collected by a CCD detector. The detector generates a spectrum from the X-rays that are diffracted from crystals, which is then compared with reference spectra. Chemical composition is estimated by comparing the generated spectra from the sample with standard spectra of known composition.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Counts from the sample must be corrected for matrix effects (penetration factor, absorption, and secondary fluorescence) to yield quantitative chemical compositions. Finally, the chemical data is gathered in a textural context, and one measurement of high entropy ceramics is shown in Figure 3.
